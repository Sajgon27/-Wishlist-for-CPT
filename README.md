This plugin allows users to create and manage a wishlist for products on a WordPress site (tomala.lublin.pl). Users can add or remove products from their wishlist with a button on each product page. The wishlist is stored in a cookie, making it accessible for both logged-in and non-logged-in users.

Features:
- Add/Remove to Wishlist: Users can toggle products in and out of their wishlist.
- Wishlist Display: A shortcode to display all wishlist items on a separate page with product details (image, price, inventory).
- Cookie-Based Storage: Wishlist data is stored in cookies, ensuring functionality for both logged-in and guest users.
- Responsive Design: The plugin is built to work seamlessly with mobile and desktop interfaces.
- The wishlist page includes an Elementor form that lets users submit their current wishlist to the admin. 
The form sends the wishlist data, including product details, to the site administrator for follow-up or further action.

Shortcodes:
[wishlist_button]: Displays the add/remove button for each product.
[wishlist_display]: Displays the list of products added to the wishlist.
